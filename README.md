# Smart Home

## Welcome ##

Smart House is a project created by [Timbo Cole](https://github.com/DiNozzo97) and [Nick Fitton](https://github.com/Alignak) as part as our First Year Computer Science Course.

It is based around the current idea of "Internet of Things" and is an interactive scale house which is controllable from a Web Application, that encases all of the required electronics inside of it.
